      <div class="splash-card-body">
        <p>Gradient descent is a fundamental algorithm in both theory and practice, which has been widely  used in continuous optimization, machine learning, and so on. Identifying its counterpart in quantum computing is not only theoretically interesting but also could lead to practical quantum algorithms. A conventional approach to quantum speedups in optimization relies on the quantum acceleration of intermediate steps of corresponding classical algorithms, while keeping the overall trajectory of classical algorithms and the quality of their solutions.

        <p>
        We propose Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) as a truly quantum counterpart of classical gradient methods, which is derived from the path integral of classical dynamical systems corresponding to the continuous-time limit of classical gradient descent algorithms. We establish QHD’s convergence to the global optimum in both convex and non-convex settings. More importantly, QHD is described as a time-dependent Hamiltonian evolution that can be efficiently simulated on both digital and analog quantum computers. By embedding QHD’s Hamiltonian evolution into the evolution of the so-called Quantum Ising Machine (including D-Wave and others),  we empirically observe that the D-Wave-implemented QHD outperforms a selection of state-of-the-art gradient-based classical solvers and the standard quantum adiabatic algorithm, based on the time-to-solution metric, on non-convex constrained quadratic programming instances up to 75 dimensions. Finally, we propose a “three-phase picture” to explain the behavior of QHD, especially its difference from the quantum adiabatic algorithm.
