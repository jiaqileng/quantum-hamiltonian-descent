We use pseudo-spectral method to simulate QHD in two-dimensions for all the instance functions. 


To-Do list:
1. Ethan: replace the old data files with new ones on BOX; (**Do not overwrite the data!!!**)
2. Ethan: push the new potentials256.mat (with all instances) to this repo; (replace the old one)

Let Jiaqi and Joseph know!

3. Joseph: re-run the CPP program and check it if works (make sure the output wfn data name matches the dataset Ethan uploaded); 
4. Joseph: mention the instances that require special parameters in the pseudospectral solver.
5. Jiaqi: change the qhd wave function name in the fig2 plot script.
