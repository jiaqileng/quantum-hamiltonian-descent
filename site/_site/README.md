## Viewing the website
To view the site and interact with it you can set up Jekyll and build it locally. See https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ for setup info. The best option for viewing is to run Jekyll with
```
jekyll serve --livereload
```
The website will be available at `localhost:4000` in your browser (tested and developed so far with Firefox 94.0.2).
